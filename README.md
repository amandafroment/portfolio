## Overview

This app is currently a WIP. I will be displaying all of the projects I have worked on while attending General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, which includes a MERN stack application, as well as projects done with Python/Django, Node.js/Express.js/MongoDB, and the very first static project I ever fully coded in HTML/CSS/Javascript.
